JIRA Enhancements
=================

This is a [GreaseMonkey][gm] userscript designed for [JIRA][jira] OnDemand
instances to make things more suitable for my workflow.

It is also fully compatible with [Chrom[e|ium]'s user script engine][cus] and was
written with Chrome in mind. This required some pretty ugly hacks to bypass
Chrome's extremely restrictive sandboxing.

Also note that this makes **a lot** of AJAX calls to get additional data from
the API.
